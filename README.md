Welcome to StingLaser! This tool does NOT prove the presence of a Stingray/IMSI catcher.

It will only highly anomalies (downgrades, unexpected network IDs, no encryption) that could be consistent with rogue base stations.

Legitimate networks can cause the same behavior (roaming, tower maintenance, weak signal).

Use for educational and research purposes only. This is not "catch" your unethical neighbors, or real stingrays (there's better tools and legal licenses for that). Do NOT use unethically if you're just poking around.

Currently for Linux users only.

install:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 modemmanager
